Arjuna said: and, knowing, wavers not,
True to the farther Truth; when, holding this,
It deems no other treasure comparable,
But, harboured there, cannot be stirred or shook
By any gravest grief, call that state "peace,"
That happy severance Yoga; call that man
The perfect Yogin!

Q: What is the main lesson of the Bhagavad Gita? A:
Manifold the Bharata! when Wickedness
Is strong, I rise, from age to age, and take
Visible shape, and move a man with men,
Succouring the good, thrusting the evil back,
And setting Virtue on her seat again.
Who knows the truth touching my births on earth
And my divine work, when he quits the flesh

Therefore, O Prince, the wise man acts without thought of reward, seeing the Lords of Hearts,
And seeking fasts, breathe from the bond
Between the senses and the sense-world. Sweet
As Amrit is its first taste, but its last
Bitter as poison. 'Tis of Rajas, Prince!
And foul and "dark" the Pleasure is which thou knowest not,
O Slayer of thy Foes! Albeit I be

Riseth, without its will, to life new-born.

Surcease of works, and, at another time,
Service through work. Of these twain plainly tell
Which is the better end?
